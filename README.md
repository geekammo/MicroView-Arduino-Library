# MicroView Arduino Library

Developed by [Geek Ammo Pty Ltd](http://www.geekammo.com) based on Arduino and other Open Source libraries.  

## Description

Arduino library for MicroView.  

## Required Libraries

1. [Time.h](http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Time.html) NOTE: Only required when using clock/time functions.  For example the MicroViewDemo in the example folder.

## Installation

1. Change directory to Arduino's main directory
2. cd libraries
3. mkdir MicroView
4. cd MicroView
5. git clone https://github.com/geekammo/MicroView-Arduino-Library.git .
6. Start Arduino IDE.
7. MicroView example is located at, File--->Example--->MicroView--->MicroViewDemo

### Example 1 - Hello World!
<pre><code>
# include &lt;MicroView.h&gt;

void setup() {
    uView.begin();
}

void loop() {
    uView.print("HelloWorld");
    uView.display();		// display current page buffer
}
</code></pre>

### Example 2 - Basic Drawing
<pre><code>
# include &lt;MicroView.h&gt;

void setup() {
    uView.begin();
    uView.clear(PAGE);		// clear the page buffer
}

void loop() {
    uView.line(0,0,64,48);
    uView.circle(32,24,10);
    uView.rect(10,10,20,20);
    uView.pixel(50,5);
    uView.setCursor(0,40);
    uView.print(" MicroView");
    uView.display();		// display current page buffer
}
</code></pre>

### Example 3 - Widgets
<pre><code>
# include &lt;MicroView.h&gt;

MicroViewWidget *widget,*widget2;

void setup() {
    uView.begin();
    uView.clear(PAGE);
    widget= new MicroViewGauge(32,30,0,100);  // draw Gauge widget at x=32,y=30,min=0, max=100
    widget2= new MicroViewSlider(0,0,0,100);  // draw Slider widget at x=0,y=0,min=0, max=100
}

void loop() {
    for(int i=0; i&lt;=100;i++) {
        widget->setValue(i);	// give a value to widget
        widget2->setValue(i);
        uView.display();		// display current page buffer
    }
}
</code></pre>

### Example 4 - Communication
<pre><code>
# include &lt;MicroView.h&gt;

void setup() {
    uView.begin();
    uView.clear(PAGE);
	Serial.begin(115200);	// user decide the baud rate
}

void loop() {
    uView.checkComm();
}
</code></pre>
